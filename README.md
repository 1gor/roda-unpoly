# Unpoly for Roda

Easily add support for the server protocol expected by Unpoly.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "roda-unpoly"
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install roda-unpoly

## Usage

TODO: Fill me in

## Where are the Javascript and CSS assets?

We've chosen not to bundle those assets with the gem as they might be updated more
frequently then this library. Roda is also asset-agnostic (for the most part),
so it's easier if you bring in your assets as you see fit for your specific needs.
